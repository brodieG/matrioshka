Package: recsub
Title: Programmable Non-Standard Evaluation
Description: Tools to implement programmable Non-Standard Evaluation (NSE).
  `recsub` works by recursively substituting symbols that point to language
  objects.  The semantics are the same as they are for non-language R objects so
  usage is intuitive.
